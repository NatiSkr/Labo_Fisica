New repo, currently updating! cheers

It contains assignments for the virtual course of "Mecanica y Termodinamica" at Universidad de Buenos Aires.
It's main aim was to serve as an introduction to programming, Python to be more precise.
We used Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory, the code here is adapted so you wouldn't need either.

The necessary packages to execute the code are:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- imageio
- iamge-ffmpeg
- panda

Use of a virtual enviroment is heavily advised.

You can install them with pip, check if it's installed with:

'py -m pip --version' on Windows

'$ python -m pip --version' on Linux/macOS

To check the installation guide for pip check: https://pypi.org/project/pip/
